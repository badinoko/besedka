Текст (ориг):
Deep in the tangled forests and sprawling vineyards of Anderson Valley’s wine country in Mendocino, California, is a new kind of cannabis tourism experience centered on rare landrace cannabis strains. It’s called The Madrones.
In the southern-most point of the Emerald Triangle, founders Jim Roberts and Brian Adkinson combined their love of wine and rare landrace cannabis genetics into a bucolic experience that could easily exist in Provence or along the Mediterranean coast.
Landrace varieties like Acapulco Gold and Durban Poison from below the equator create sativa growing structures with uplifting effects, whereas varieties from the north, like Hindu Kush and Afghan, have indica bud structures with heavier highs.
The Madrones is a compound that consists of elegant accommodations, a farm-to-table restaurant, two wine tasting rooms, an event venue called The Brambles nestled in a redwood grove, and an apothecary-style dispensary by the owners’ cannabis brand, The Bohemian Chemist, which specializes in rare landrace strains.
Landrace cannabis strains exist as the earth’s purest expression of the plant. They are the wild, original varieties that evolved naturally in specific geographic regions around the world, and have adapted distinct characteristics—and highs—based on their environments.

U.S. Marijuana Consumers Have Spent More Than $4.1 Billion On Pre-Rolled Joints In The Past Year And A Half, Industry Report Finds
Текст (ориг):
Sorry, but nothing matches your search terms Please try again with some different keywords
American marijuana consumers have spent more than $4.1 billion on pre-rolled joints over the past year and a half, according to a new industry report, with the products now making up about 15.9 percent of the cannabis market.
Among the latest trends in the pre-roll market, it adds, is the continued growth of specialty infused pre-rolls, which are sold as a premium product and typically contain marijuana concentrate. Those products, which command higher price points than standard pre-rolls, accounted for almost half (44 percent) of the pre-roll market during the first half of 2024.
The findings were compiled by product manufacturer Custom Cones USA using data from the cannabis intelligence firm Headset, which collects point-of-sale data in a dozen U.S. states. It's Custom Cones's third year releasing a white paper on the current state of the pre-roll market.
“Every year we like to hunker down and look at the story the data is telling,” Harrison Bard, the company's co-founder and CEO, said in a press release. “Thanks to the help of our partners at Headset, we can now see even more clearly that pre-rolls are continuing to dominate the market on an upward trajectory that confirms our belief that pre-rolls remain a potent and profitable symbol of the cannabis industry as a whole.”

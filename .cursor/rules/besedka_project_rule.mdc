  - The project is called Besedka. It contains an embedded seed store called "Magic Beans"
  - The platform uses Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Telegram Login
  - Authorization is via Telegram only (no email/password)
  - Users are grouped into five roles: owner, admin, store_owner, user, guest
  - Grow logs must support public/private visibility
  - Built-in site chat is text-only, shared for all logged-in users
  - Store admin can manage only store-related data
  - Guests can view the catalog, public grow logs, gallery — but not chat or comments
  - ⚠️ Telegram bot is already implemented externally. Do NOT generate or code the bot inside this project.
